# Discovery Playbook

## Phase Overview

Duration: 1-2 weeks

The discovery phase establishes shared understanding of the problem, constraints, and success criteria before any implementation begins.

## Objectives

1. Understand the business problem and desired outcomes
2. Map technical landscape and constraints
3. Identify stakeholders and decision-makers
4. Define success metrics and acceptance criteria
5. Assess risks and dependencies

## Checklist

### Week 1: Understanding

- [ ] **Stakeholder mapping**
  - Who are the decision-makers?
  - Who are the end users?
  - Who are the technical owners?

- [ ] **Problem statement**
  - What problem are we solving?
  - What's the current state?
  - What does success look like?

- [ ] **Technical landscape**
  - What systems exist today?
  - What are the integration points?
  - What are the constraints (security, compliance, network)?

### Week 2: Planning

- [ ] **Success metrics defined**
  - Quantitative measures
  - Qualitative goals
  - Timeline expectations

- [ ] **Risk assessment**
  - Technical risks
  - Organizational risks
  - Timeline risks

- [ ] **Scope agreement**
  - What's in scope for pilot?
  - What's explicitly out of scope?
  - What are the dependencies?

## Discovery Interview Questions

### Business Stakeholders

1. What business outcome are you trying to achieve?
2. How do you measure success today?
3. What happens if this project fails?
4. Who needs to approve the final solution?

### Technical Stakeholders

1. What does the current architecture look like?
2. What are the compliance/security requirements?
3. What are the existing integration patterns?
4. What's the deployment process?

### End Users

1. What's your current workflow?
2. What are the biggest pain points?
3. How would you use an AI-powered solution?
4. What would make you not use it?

## Deliverables

| Artifact | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| Stakeholder map | FDE |
| Problem statement (1-pager) | FDE + Customer |
| Technical landscape diagram | FDE |
| Success metrics document | FDE + Customer |
| Risk register | FDE |
| Scope agreement | Both parties |

## Exit Criteria

Discovery is complete when:

- [ ] Problem statement is written and approved
- [ ] Success metrics are defined and agreed
- [ ] Technical constraints are documented
- [ ] Risks are identified and mitigation planned
- [ ] Scope is agreed and documented
- [ ] Go/no-go decision is made for pilot
